# Instructions to setup

In the project directory, run `npm install` to install required dependencies. The project has two dependencies - jquery for dom manipulation, and keymaster to make handling keyboard events more convenient

# Instructions to run

A basic web server for the project (because of cors issues), if you a node.js environment is available the quickest way would be to install http-server - a basic static server that you can run off the shelf without any config or code required. You can use it as follows:

```
npm i -g http-server
cd project_directory
http-server
```
Then browse to the port your server is running on (example http://localhost:8080)
